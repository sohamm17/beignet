Cross Compiler HowTo
====================

Beignet supports both PC devices with full profile and embedded/handheld
devices with embeded profile. This document describes how to build Beignet
and OpenCL kernels for a target machine (embedded/handheld devices) in a
host machine with the help of cross compiler, and also the large-size-reduced
Beignet driver package for the target machine.

Build Beignet with a cross compiler
-----------------------------------

Besides the general cross compile methods, reference the following options when
configure Beignet with cmake.

- LLVM_INSTALL_DIR
  Beignet depends on llvm+clang, this option refers to the path of llvm-config,
  llvm-as, llvm-link and clang in the cross compiler environment.

- CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
  Some cross compiler systems forbid the usage of rpath in binaries/libraries,
  set this option to be TRUE.

- GEN_PCI_ID
  It is the GPU pci_id of the target machine, for example, 0x0162 is the pciid
  of Intel Ivybridge GPU, and 0x0f31 is Intel Baytrail GPU. The information can
  be queried with command 'lspci -n'.

- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
  This option controls the prefix of installation path.

Distribution of large-size-reduced Beignet driver package
---------------------------------------------------------

On embedded/handheld devices, storage and memory are scarce, it is necessary to
provide only the OpenCL runtime library without OpenCL compiler, and only the
executable binary kernel is supported on such devices.

It means that just distribute libcl.so and libgbeinterp.so (~320k in total after strip)
are enough for OpenCL embeded profile in the target machine.

Build OpenCL kernels with OpenCL offline compiler
-------------------------------------------------

Since the target machine does not contain the OpenCL compiler, the OpenCL source
kernel need to be compiled with an OpenCL offline compiler (gbe_bin_generater)
into binary kernel in the host machine, and the OpenCL application can load the
binary kernel with function clCreateProgramWithBinary.

The OpenCL offline compiler gbe_bin_generater is the result of Beignet build and
locates at .../your_path_to_build/backend/src/gbe_bin_generater, see below for the
command options.

gbe_bin_generater INFILE [-pbuild_parameter] -oOUTFILE -tGEN_PCI_ID

For example, the following command builds OpenCL source kernel from file 'mykernel.cl'
for Ivybridge with pci_id 0x0162, and write the result (executable binary kernel)
into file 'mykernel.bin'.

gbe_bin_generater mykernel.cl -omykernel.bin -t0x0162
