  /*! Function arguments are a bit tricky since we must implement the proper C
   *  semantic: we can therefore address the function arguments as we want and
   *  we can even modify them. This leads to interesting challenges. We identify
   *  several cases:
   *
   *  case 1:
   *  int f (__global int *dst, int x[16], int y) {
   *    dst[get_global_id(0)] = x[16] + y;
   *  }
   *  Here x and y will be pushed to registers using the Curbe. No problem, we
   *  can directly used the pushed registers
   *
   *  case 2:
   *  int f (__global int *dst, int x[16], int y) {
   *    dst[get_global_id(0)] = x[get_local_id(0)] + y;
   *  }
   *  Here x is indirectly accessed. We need to perform a gather from memory. We
   *  can simply gather it from the curbe in memory
   *
   *  case 3:
   *  int f (__global int *dst, int x[16], int y) {
   *    x[get_local_id(0)] = y + 1;
   *    int *ptr = get_local_id(0) % 2 ? x[0] : x[1];
   *    dst[get_global_id(0)] = *ptr;
   *  }
   *  Here we modify the function argument since it is valid C. Problem is that
   *  we are running in SIMD mode while the data are scalar (in both memory and
   *  registers). In that case, we just spill everything to memory (using the
   *  stack) and reload it from here when needed.
