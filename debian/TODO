beignet is currently compiled with these options:
  -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -msse3 -mssse3 -msse4.1
this may generate code failing with SIGILL on older CPUs not supporting these sse levels
(needs verification on i386 and amd64 platforms)
even though beignet will not support these ancient hardware anyway ...
... it should not crash if the icd is loaded to check for platform support there

maybe switch to more conservative compiler options for the the routines needed for testing platform support
