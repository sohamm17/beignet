+Supported Targets
+-----------------
+
+Beignet aims to support Gen7 and later Intel integrated GPUs, i.e:
+ * Ivy Bridge (ix-3xxx) and later Intel Core processors
+ * Bay Trail and later Intel Atom processors with Intel HD (not PowerVR) graphics
+
+As these GPUs are not necessarily backwards compatible, Beignet will not attempt to use processors it does not recognise.  Hence, processors introduced after this release of Beignet (even within the Skylake family) may require a newer version of beignet-opencl-icd (and possibly the kernel, linux-image-amd64 or -i386): for Debian stable, this [may be available](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=beignet-opencl-icd&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all) in [-backports](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html#_updates_and_backports).
+
+Not all processor models have an integrated GPU, and systems that also have a discrete GPU may disable the integrated GPU: check _xrandr --listproviders_ or see [here](https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Optimus/).
+
+Attempting to run Beignet on unsupported hardware should return CL_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND; if it does anything else (especially crashing) please [report a bug](#howtocontribute).
