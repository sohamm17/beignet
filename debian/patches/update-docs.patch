 Supported Targets
 -----------------
 
+Beignet aims to support Gen7 and later Intel HD (not PowerVR) integrated GPUs, i.e:
+
  * 3rd Generation Intel Core Processors "Ivybridge".
  * 3rd Generation Intel Atom Processors "BayTrail".
  * 4th Generation Intel Core Processors "Haswell", need kernel patch if your linux kernel older than 4.2, see the "Known Issues" section.

  * 6th Generation Intel Core Processors "Skylake" and "Kabylake".
  * 5th Generation Intel Atom Processors "Broxten" or "Apollolake".
 
+As these GPUs are not necessarily backwards compatible, Beignet will not attempt to use processors it does not recognise.  Hence, processors introduced after this release of Beignet (even within a supported family) may require a newer version of beignet-opencl-icd (and possibly the kernel, linux-image-amd64 or linux-image-i686-pae): for Debian stable, this [may be available](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=beignet-opencl-icd&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all) in [-backports](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html#_updates_and_backports).
+
+Not all processor models have an integrated GPU (Beignet does _not_ support running OpenCL on the CPU itself - see [pocl-opencl-icd](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=pocl-opencl-icd&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all) for that).  Systems that also have a discrete GPU may disable the integrated GPU: check _xrandr --listproviders_ or see [here](https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Optimus/).

+Attempting to run Beignet on unsupported hardware should return CL_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND; if it does anything else (especially crashing) please [report a bug](#howtocontribute).
