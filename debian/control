Description: OpenCL library for Intel GPUs
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package contains the shared library for the Intel implementation,
 which supports the integrated GPUs of Ivy Bridge (ix-3xxx)/Bay Trail and
 later Intel processors.
 .
 Future processors (even in the same family) are likely to require future
 versions of this package; in Debian stable, these will be provided in
 -backports.

Description: OpenCL library for Intel GPUs - transitional dummy package
 This is a transitional dummy package (the real package has been renamed
 to beignet-opencl-icd).  It can safely be removed.
